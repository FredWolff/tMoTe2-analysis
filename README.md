# tMoTe2-analysis

#### Analysis code for determining the magnetic, B, and dielectric, D, field dependence of the presumed CDWs at hole filling factors 1/3, 1/2 and 2/3.
#### The main file "discrete_v_B_dependence" extracts data from many 2D gate-gate maps taken at different magnetic fields. This gives a large resolution in D and n, while compromising on resolution in B, which is limited to [0.2, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.75, 2, 4]T.
#### The low number of unique B-data points limits our ability to make precise statistical tests in the B-dependence for all D values. The secondary file "Landau_fan_model_comparison" takes n-B maps at fixed D, with a far greater resolution in B.
